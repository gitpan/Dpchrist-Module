NAME
    Dpchrist::Module - utilities for Perl modules

DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.23 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

    This module contains:

    1. Override routines for ExtUtils::MakeMaker which add optional rules
    and/or targets to the Makefile generated by WriteMakefile().

    2. Test scripts I commonly use in my modules.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Note that when this module is installed the first time, the command
    'perl Makefile.PL' will generate a warning similar to:

        skipping Dpchrist::Module::MakefilePL: Can't locate Dpchrist/Module/
        MakefilePL.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/
        5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 
        /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) 
        at Makefile.PL line 23.

    The warning may be safely ignored.

  DEPENDENCIES
    This module depends upon itself.

    For the curious, see Makefile.PL in the source distribution root
    directory for the BEGIN{eval{...}} solution to this chicken-and-egg
    problem.
