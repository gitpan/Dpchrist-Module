DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.25 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

    This module contains:

    1. Override routines for ExtUtils::MakeMaker which add optional rules
    and/or targets to the Makefile generated by WriteMakefile().

    2. Test scripts I commonly use in my modules.

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ make install

    Minimal:

        $ cpan Module::Dpchrist

    Complete:
